# Web Spider
It's a simple web page spider that can perform crawling, indexing, and filtering during the search. In the world of the internet, there's a handy tool called a web page spider. It's like a little explorer that can crawl through websites, picking out important stuff and leaving behind what's not needed. This spider is smartâ€”it knows what you're looking for and brings it back to you. Whether you're doing research or just browsing, this spider is there to help you find what you need online. I used python 3 and MySql database. You can store the indexed data in MySql data base.
